# EEGNN-XAI
This repository implements an explainable analysis for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) applied to hyperspectral image classification. It integrates popular XAI methods to visualize the influence of spectral bands and spatial attention, improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of GNN-based remote sensing models.
